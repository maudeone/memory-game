## Description

This is a memory game project made with React. In this project I used React hooks to work with an array of Pokemon to be shuffled randomly after being clicked. After completing this project I feel comfortable using React and manipulating the DOM. In the future I would simply add more style to the app and add a game over/ you win prompt.
